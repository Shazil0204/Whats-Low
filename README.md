In many homes, when one person uses something—like food or drinks—they sometimes forget to tell others. This can lead to surprises when someone goes to get a snack and finds out it’s all gone! This can cause several problems, such as:

- **Disappointment**: People might get upset if they want something and it’s not there.
- **Wasted Resources**: Someone might buy the same item again, wasting money.
- **Last-Minute Trips**: Families might have to rush to the store at the last minute.

To solve these issues, we’re creating **What’s Low?**, a family app designed to help everyone keep track of what items are used and what needs to be bought.
